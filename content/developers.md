Being a developer is hard.

Sure, you can write code. 
But in small or underfunded projects, you are also asked to wear a lot of hats.
- project manager
- project architect
- tester
- grant writer
- community liason

With more than 12 years experience as a full stack developer, quality engineer, architect AND linguist/language revitalization, I am here to help fill in any gaps!

### Feasabilty and Ethicality Consulting

Unfortunately, I am often hired by communities to clean up the mess left behind by unethical or non-transparent development. Don't let that be you!

Every Indigneous community is different, making "right-sized" projects different in each case. 

I believe most developers I work with are well-intentioned. But factors such as deadlines, budget, or inexperience working outside of the tech sector can leave communities in a worse place after the project is done.

My feasablity and ethicality consulting services will walk you through all the considerations for your project and community, so that everyone is happy with the final project!


#### Documentation Review

Let's face it, your software is only as good as someone's ability to use it. And they can only use it if it's documented!

Don't let your end user be the first person to struggle through your documentation. I am happy to walk both technical and end-user documentation to make sure your app is ready for prime time.

#### Test Stragety Planning

Both automated and manual testing strategies

#### Test Writing

Unit tests, integrations tests, E2E tests, even manual test scenarios. You need tests? I can write them. TS, JS, Python, .NET, and more.

#### Acceptance Testing

I like breaking apps. And when I do it, you get a heads up before you have to frantically fix bugs found by your end users!

When you hire me to acceptance test your app, you get detailed feedback about bugs and errors - written by a developer, for a developer. So you can fix things fast.

#### Project Architecture Consultant

I can review your architecture, from both a technical perspective and a community perspective. 

Questions I ask:
- Does this architecture make sense in terms of technology and goals of the community?
- Is this architecture sustainable by the community long term?
- What training does the community need to maintain this project once it is done?

#### and more!

I love getting my hands into code. If you need something, I may be your guy.
