##### PT Anderson

![PT Anderson](images/headshot.jpg)

I am a linguist anthropologist by training and a computer programmer by trade. I have more than 12 years of experience working with Indigenous, Native American and First Nations communities in pursuit of language revitalization.

I am passionate about the intersection of language revitalization and accessible technology. 

I firmly believe that Indigenous communities should not only fully own their technologies but feel empowered to maintain their digital projects long term. 

To that end, I offer a variety of services design for you to get the most out of your language technology project!
