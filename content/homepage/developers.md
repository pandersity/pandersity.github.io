Are you a developer working with an Indigenous community? Or creating software to be used by communities?

As a full stack developer with more than a decade of experience in both technology and language revitalization, I offer a number of unique services that can take your project to the next level.

### Feasabilty and Ethicality Consulting

Unfortunately, I am often hired by communities to clean up the mess left behind by unethical or non-transparent development. Don't let that be you!

Every Indigneous community is different, making "right-sized" projects different in each case. 

I believe most developers I work with are well-intentioned. But factors such as deadlines, budget, or inexperience working outside of the tech sector can leave communities in a worse place after the project is done.

My feasablity and ethicality consulting services will walk you through all the considerations for your project and community, so that everyone is happy with the final project!


#### Documentation Review

Let's face it, your software is only as good as someone's ability to use it. And they can only use it if it's documented!

Don't let your end user be the first person to struggle through your documentation. I am happy to walk both technical and end-user documentation to make sure your app is ready for prime time.

#### Test Stragety Planning

Both automated and manual testing strategies

#### Test Writing

Unit tests, integrations tests, E2E tests, even manual test scenarios. You need tests? I can write them. Python, TS, JS, .NET, and more.

#### Acceptance Testing

I like breaking apps. And when I do it, you get a heads up before you have to frantically fix bugs found by your end users!

When you hire me to acceptance test your app, you get detailed feedback about bugs and errors - written by a developer, for a developer. So you can fix things fast.

#### and more!

I love getting my hands into code. If you need something
