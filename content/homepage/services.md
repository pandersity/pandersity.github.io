I sometimes have a hard time describing what I *do*. 
In short, I am a bit of a swiss-army knife when it comes to language revitalization and technology consulting.

The following is a list of tasks I am often hired to do.


### Dictionary Consulting
Indigenous language dictionaries are my specialty. 

I have worked with numerous communities undertaking dicitonary projects, at all stages of development - everything from *where do we start?* to *we're done, now how do we publish this online?*

 As author of [*Revitalization Lexicography*](https://uapress.arizona.edu/book/revitalization-lexicography), I firmly believe that dictionaries done with planning and care can help reverse langauge shift.

 I can help with aspects of:
  - dictionary planning: what are your goals and how can you use your dictionary to achieve them?
  - technology selection
  - customization of dicitonary technology
  - bulk editing, importing or exporting of dictionary data: sometimes you have to be creative!
  - offering designs for community sessions on how to get words into the dictionary
  - dictionary technology training for community members


### Technology Training and Documentation

Sometimes, you or your community inherit technology that you did not select. With little instructuion on how to use it.
Or perhaps your software forced an update, and now it does not work like you expect it to.

Unforutately, valuable language resources can be trapped in technology.

I am available to 
- learn the technology
- creatively jail break your data, if needed
- provide training on how to use it longterm
- and leave you with written documentation that will allow you to use and update the technology ongoing

### Technical Communication Liason
There is nothing more frustrating than trying to cut through developer tech-speak on your project, especially if you are not getting the technology results that you want.

I can help work with your developers to get your projects on track. With years of experience at both large tech companies and community-based projects, I pin down areas of miscommunication and help explain the gaps, all in nontechnical speak that you can understand.


### Miscellaneous Tech Tasks

Sometimes, you just need something done. 

A myriad of tasks could fall into this category. Here are some examples!
- Connect your Google Workspace to your web domain
- Backing up your website
- Renewing your SSL certificate
- Provide guidance on how to organize digital knowledge and data
- Select a backup battery so your website server does not go down during a power outage
